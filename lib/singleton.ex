  Singleton.

  Start a new singleton process. Optionally provide the `on_conflict`
  parameter which will be called whenever a singleton process shuts
  down due to another instance being present in the cluster.

  This function needs to be executed on all nodes where the singleton
  process is allowed to live. The actual process will be started only
  once; a manager process is started on each node for each singleton
  to ensure that the process continues on (possibly) another node in
  case of node disconnects or crashes.
